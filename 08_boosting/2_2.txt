For fitting the classifier, I used all the default parameters. This means that 100 decision trees were used and there were no weights added to any of the classes. Gini impurity is the default impurity measure, so I used this as well. I did not impose a maximum or minimum node count, so allowed the trees to grow fully since random forest are fairly robust to overfitting. I retured a value of 0.8134 for accuracy, 0.7732 for precision, and 0.7282 for recall.
