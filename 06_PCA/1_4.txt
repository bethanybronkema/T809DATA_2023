Judging from the plots, the ones that display approximately a straight line are the ones that correlate best with dimension 1. The dimensions 3 and 4 seem to display the most significant correlations. According to the chart at the start of the assignment, these features correspond to perimeter mean and area mean. This makes sense as dimension 1 is radius mean, and the perimeter and area of a sample will be related to its radius.
