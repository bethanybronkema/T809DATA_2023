For the eigenvalue plot, the trend is that the eigen values sharply decrease until the values level off between values 10-15. This happens because all 30 dimensions are not required to contain most of the information in the dataset, showing that the data could be reduced from 30 dimensions to somewhere around 7 while still retaining most of the information. The cumulative variance shows the same information, but as a percentage of variance retained at each additional eigenvalue. For example, it shows that if we reduce the dimensions of the data to 7, we retain approximately 90percent of the information. The remaining dimensions provide increasingly less information as they are added, as seen by the shape of the plot.
